# esg-frontend

> This is version 2 of the Engineers.sg Website.

## Notes

Build with NuxtJS as universal app

VuetifyJS is currently used for look and feel but this may change, need to do some treeshaking for now to reduce bundle size

Need to pre-generate routes

Need to handle case if dynamic route is not pregenerated

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
